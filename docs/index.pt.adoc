== Overview

== Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119[RFC 2119].

== A note on naming

The system, in its entirety, is called "tBTC". In this document and throughout
the project, the fungible Bitcoin-backed token is called "TBTC" to distinguish
it from the rest of the project, and strongly suggest an eventual ticker.
