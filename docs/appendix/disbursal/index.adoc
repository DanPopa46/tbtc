= Redemption Payment and Disbursal Scenarios

:pre-term-redemption-footnote: footnote:pre-term-redemption[Pre-term deposits \
can only be redeemed by the TDT owner.]

For a BTC lot size of {btc-lot-size} corresponding to {tbtc-lot-size} and signer
fee of {signer-fee} ({signer-fee-basis-points} basis points), the following
table describes the amounts disbursed to each party at redemption time for
pre- and at-term deposits, depending on who holds the TDT and FRT, and who
initiates redemption. Three possible parties exist in the table—A, B, and
C—and the listed scenarios cover situations where the same party holds the
two tokens and initiates redemption, different parties have each role, and
possibilities in between.

|===

Note that all of these scenarios can be conceptualized as the TDT holder
always receiving the 1 TBTC used to redeem the deposit; when the TDT holder
redeems their own deposit, the TBTC they receive would be from themselves, so
they simply owe less. Similarly, the FRT holder always receives escrow back
when redeeming pre-term, so in cases where the redeemer holds the FRT, the
redeemer simply does not owe the signer fee at redemption time.
